# Number Guesser V2

**Number Guesser** is an upgraded iteration of my previous game, [Number Guesser V1](https://github.com/jorgedoiany/number-guesser-game-v1.git), challenging players to uncover a secret number between 1 and 10. The game features an input field for guesses and includes two buttons: one to submit guesses and another to reset the game upon winning or conceding. Clues are provided to help players determine if their guess is higher or lower than the secret number. It serves as an engaging pastime, enhancing deduction and logic skills, and is well-suited for beginners in programming seeking a practical project, or casual gamers looking for a fun and intellectually stimulating experience in number guessing and mental puzzles.
